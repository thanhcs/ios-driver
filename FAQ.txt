Troubleshooting configuration issues:

// THIS IS A TEST

1) MobileSafari.app/Info.plist (Permission denied)
error starting instrument for session XXX, Cannot change the default device for the app.
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/
iPhoneSimulator6.0.sdk/Applications/MobileSafari.app/Info.plist (Permission denied)

Safari's Info.plist file contains the device family safari can be launched on.
It looks like : "UIDeviceFamily":[1,2]
1 is for iphone. 2 is for ipad.
Instruments doesn't allow to choose the platform, and always starts the default ( first one in the
list ).

ios-driver changes the the order of the list to  "UIDeviceFamily":[2,1] when safari on ipad is
requested. To be able to do that, it needs write access to the Info.plist file.


2) WARNING IOSSimulatorManager.restoreExiledSDKs /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/
Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/exiledSDKs doesn't exist.
By default, instruments starts the simulator with the latest installed SDK. ( last one in the 'iOS
Simulator SDKs:' list when doing $xcodebuild -showsdks )

If you want ios-driver to start with something else than the default, the current solution involves
 moving sdk folders around in /Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer.
ios-driver will move the sdks from  /Developer/SDKs/ to /Developer/exiledSDKs , start the simulator,
 and put them back.
For that to work, you need to create a "exiledSDKs" folder in Developer next to the "SDKs" one
containing all your SDKs, and give write access to both.

A normal install looks like :
/SDKs/
    iPhoneSimulator5.0.sdk
    iPhoneSimulator5.1.sdk
    iPhoneSimulator6.0.sdk

that will start 6.0

To start 5.1, ios-driver will do the following setup :
/SDKs/
    iPhoneSimulator5.0.sdk
    iPhoneSimulator5.1.sdk
/exiledSDKs/
      iPhoneSimulator6.0.sdk

start the simulator, it will start on 5.1

and put the files back.
